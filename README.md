MelooonWeb
==========

Melooon is a WIP plugin for Bukkit (Minecraft). Its main perpose is to provide a fast and secure way of connecting to a Minecraft server through a web application. This repo is the website side of the project, providing an open source server administration panel in the web.

There are many other alternatives, like Melooon, however this is the first of its kind to be 100% open source, completely free of any horrid licence, and super easy to use.

The software is professionally designed from the bottom up, and is perfect for bukkit server providers who offer any type of plan. Wether or not your bukkit server is running on a VPS, or a dedicated server, Melooon (the launcher) runs just like the default minecraft server.

Although the software is in-complete, this is the plan.

- None
 	- Melooon (the web interface) will run on **OUR** own servers.
 	- The reason this repo is open, is for your own personal security.
 	- We want you to know exactly how our web-software works, so if you decide to run it yourself, you dont have any fears. 	
- **If you're running it yourself:**
	- Melooon will be able to run on any *Apache* server with *mod_rewrite* installed, and (pretty much) any version of *MySQL* server
